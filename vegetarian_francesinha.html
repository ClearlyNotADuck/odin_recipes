    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Like a Portuguese version of a Croque Monsieur, only with far more meat and a tomatoey, beery sauce which you can spice up with some chilli, if preferred. Belly busting and described as a 'heart attack on a plate', this is a food that is local to Porto and made in a few different ways.</p>
    <p><em>As the boyfriend is vegetarian and I really wanted him to try this portuguese delicacy we compromised on a vegetarian version for him and a "bursting with meat" version for myself.</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 vegan sausages</li>
      <li>2 vegan smoked sausages</li>
      <li>2 vegan burgers</li>
      <li>4 slices bread (stale is perfect)</li>
      <li>10 slices any preferred melty cheese</li>
      <li>4 slices vegan ham</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>francesinha sauce</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Sandwich filling: Cut the vegan sausages lengthwise and season with salt and pepper. Season the vegan burgers as well. Grill the vegan sausages first and then the vegan burgers.</li>
        <li>Start shaping the francesinha: first a slice of bread, then one slice of cheese, one of vegan ham, the burgers, the vegan sausages; layering between the two sandwiches until the "meat" is used up between them and you have a sandwich. Cover all of the sandwiches with the remaining sliced cheese and bung in the oven or grill until it melts.</li>
        <li>Once the cheese is melted, fry the eggs and top the sandwiches with them and pour the hot sauce over and around. Serve with fries.</li>
      </ol>
