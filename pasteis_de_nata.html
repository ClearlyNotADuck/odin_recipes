    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe for the world-famous pasteis de nata, or Portuguese custard tarts, uses just few basic ingredients but requires numerous steps and a certain amount of finesse. The results are so worth it, though, you'll want to make a double batch. The extra moisture inside the sticky dough, activated by a very hot oven, creates the signature flaky, buttery, crispy crust, which encases a custard subtly scented with lemon, cinnamon, and vanilla.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 whole egg (large)</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks (large)</li>
      <li>115g golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>2 tbsp cornflour</li>
      <li>400ml full fat (creamy) milk</li>
      <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 sheet ready rolled puff pastry</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Lightly grease a 12 hole muffin tin and pre-heat oven to 200C/180C fan</li>
      <li>Put egg, yolks, sugar & cornflour in a pan and mix well together then gradually add the milk until mixture is well mixed and smooth.</li>
      <li>Place pan on medium heat and stir constantly until mixture thickens and comes to the boil. Remove pan from heat and stir in vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>Put custard in a glass/ceramic bowl to cool and cover with cling film to prevent skin forming.</li>

      <li>On a lightly floured board, roll each round into a disc (approx. 10cm) and press the pastry discs into the muffin tin.</li>
      <li>Spoon in the cooled custard and bake for 20-25mins until golden on top. Leave to cool in the tin for 5mins then move to a cooling rack to finish cooling although they can be eaten warm.</li>
